The most confusing why to build the design system, but it will open oportunity for others to contribute and using design system with minimum knowledge of React and JSX.

Why?

Most of design system ([Chakra UI's Popover](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/components/popover) for example) components, require to use their multiple sub-components in a specific way. And it has very high chance where someone might not use set of components in the correct way.

This philosophy of design system it we can contain the mess of JSX within the design system itself. Also ensure the design layout of each component will be garanteed to be consistant every time.

See full example for [the creation of card component](./card.tsx), and [the usage](../components/project.ts)
